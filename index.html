    <h1>My name is Grey Schlarb</h1>
    <p>I'm a full-time CS student, hoping to gain a foothold in the tough market right now. I come from an electrical and construction background, but also from being a life-long daily computer user and hobbyist.</p>
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy hiking, exploring trails, foraging, gardening (hence the green theme), going to the gym, reading, self-development, messing with AI, and also playing games (RPG's).</p>
    <p>My goal is to become a well-rounded developer with knowledge of web/app development, AI development, and cyber security etiquette.</p>
